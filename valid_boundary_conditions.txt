# Valid Athena Boundary Conditions Reference

This document lists boundary condition types that may be valid in your Athena build.
Try these options if you encounter boundary condition errors.

## Common Boundary Types

- `outflow` - zero-gradient outflow boundary
- `periodic` - periodic boundary (wraps around to the other side)
- `user` - user-defined boundary condition
- `dirichlet` - Dirichlet boundary conditions (fixed values)
- `polar_wedge` - polar wedge boundary (for spherical polar coordinates)

## Notes on Docker vs Local Builds

The Docker container and your local build may have different available boundary conditions
depending on how they were configured. If one boundary type doesn't work, try another.

## How to Check Available Boundary Types

To see which boundary types are supported in your current build, you can look at the 
source code in:

```
athena/src/bvals/bvals.hpp
```

Look for definitions like `enum class BoundaryFlag` or similar that list the valid options.

## Most Compatible Options

Based on experience, the following boundary types tend to be the most universally available:
1. `outflow`
2. `periodic`
3. `user`
